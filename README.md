# Password Generator: A Scrimba Project

My solution to a password generator project from Scrimba. The goal of this project was to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to turn a Figma design into reality. The website can generate a random word with a user-defined length from 6 to 20 characters. Users can also set whether they want to include symbols or numbers inside their generated passwords.
